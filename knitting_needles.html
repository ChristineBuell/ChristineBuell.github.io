<h1>Needle Size Chart</h1>
<p>Here is a sample of the needle sizes. You'll notice that there are some holes in the US size. US size needles don't have as many in between sizes as the metric do. Actually Japanese needle conversions are even worse. While the British and US line up with Metric somewhat, Japanese needles have sizes like <em>3.6mm </em>and <em>4.2mm</em>!

<p>Blank spaces means that size doesn't exist, duplicate sizes (like US 3) means there is disagreement among different needle manufacturers. So make sure you're getting the right size 3! Some US companies fill the gap between 1 and 2 make a size 2.50mm and call it a US 1&frac12;, while useful, it's not a true US size. </p>
