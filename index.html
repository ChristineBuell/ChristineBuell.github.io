	<h1>Knitting</h1>
	<div class="sweater">

		Knitting is an artistic and rewarding hobby, and it's also a useful one! I'm writing about one of my favorite sweaters to knit: the Icelandic sweater. Icelandic sweaters are perfect for living in the Great Northwest. The weather here is damp and chilly a lot of the year and the wool is naturally water resistant and very warm.

		Traditionally spun lopi is also very thick and you can easily knit up a sweater in a few weeks. To look at it it might look like a thick fairisle sweater, but it's <strong>not</strong>! Icelandic sweaters usually have several rounds that alternate 3 different colors, and traditional fairisle can only have 2.

	<h2>Sizing up your needles!</h2>
		<p>
		Icelandic sweaters are knit on large needles of course. The main part of the sweater is usually knit with a size 10&frac12;! But whose 10&frac12;? It would be easier if the whole world used the same sizing for needles, but they don't. And systems of measurment change over time as well which can make using older knitting patterns frustrating. In the US knitting needles come in 2 size ranges: US and Metric. But if you go back a few decades you have the British needle sizes. While in the US the small needles are small numbers and go up, in the old British system the small needles were large numbers and went down! So sometimes old patterns require some guesswork!

	<h2>Website Example: Purl Soho</h2>
		<p>
		This is the webstore for <a href="https://www.purlsoho.com/">Purl Soho</a>, which is also has free patterns and tutorials. It is well laid out and has a lot of visual appeal. It is also responsive: it looks great on my iPhone! The main page has a lot of pictures of projects, and when you hover over one it an explanation and link to the pattern appears with a translucent background.
